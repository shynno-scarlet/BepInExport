You can use this Lib to export the active Scene in a Unity Game/Software as an OBJ File.

I made this for FlowScape (Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043390), but it should work with other Unity software as well.

### Installation
- Install BepInEx. (https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
- Compile the Plugin in VisualStudio or with the dotnet CLI.
- Move the Plugin Lib to the BepInEx plugins folder.
-
- Profit.
